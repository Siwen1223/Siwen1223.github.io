# üë®‚Äçüéì About Me
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [**Purdue University**](https://www.purdue.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lingxi Li](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/Faculty/Indianapolis/ptProfile?resource_id=296655&group_id=87916) and [Prof. Satish Ukkusuri](https://umnilab.github.io/?_ga=2.262274188.1279605593.1758417719-1924412767.1752791020). Prior to this, I received my Master‚Äôs degree from [**Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), under the guidance of [Prof. Dewei Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mLSocOwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Yunwen Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7eLzr2sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [CSC Lab](https://english.csc-lab.com/en/). 

My current research interests lie at the intersection of control, optimization, and learning, with their applications to *cooperative driving automation*, *traffic control* and *intelligent transportation systems*. If you share similar interests and have any interesting questions, feel free to email me üì¨ at [yang3062@purdue.edu](mailto:yang3062@purdue.edu)!

<!--My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).-->

[Valve Fleets: A Novel Control Method for Mixed Traffic Flow Regulation with Applications in Bottleneck Segments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175582), 

**Siwen Yang**, Yunwen Xu, and Dewei Li. 

**IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems**, (IEEE TITS), 2025.
- proposed a mixed traffic flow control structure, utilizing multi-lane fleets composed of a small portion of CAVs in mixed flow as mobile actuators. Multiple fleets formed within the mixed traffic flow feature a novel structure and a valve-like function that regulates both traffic volume and speed, referred to as "valve fleets", which are applied to decongest freeway bottlenecks.

[An Efficient Rolling-Horizon Approach for Cooperative Multi-Lane Platoon Formation With Undefined Configurations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709851), 

**Siwen Yang**, Yunwen Xu, Ping Wang, and Dewei Li. 

**IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems**, (IEEE TITS), 2024.
- Proposed a multi-lane platoon formation scheme that coordinates the lane-changing decisions and longitudinal trajectories of CAVs to form platoons based on each vehicle's target lane, aiming to reduce the negative impact of lane-changing maneuvers on traffic flow and improve platoon formation efficiency. The platoon configurations and vehicles' motions are jointly optimizaed dynamically to enhance flexibility.
